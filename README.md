# PingPong beta0.5.6 - Practice project üë®‚Äçüíª

A semi-finished PONG game project for practice. The core game logic is implemented, but there's room for visual improvement. The game includes the use of [SFMLUI(VUI)](https://github.com/VukMar/SFMLUI), a custom library for UI elements.

To anyone exploring this repository, I hope you find it interesting. Feel free to provide feedback on how I can enhance the code. üë®‚Äçüíª Practice Project üë®‚Äçüéì
